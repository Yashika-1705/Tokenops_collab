# time_budget -- opt-in wall-clock ceiling

Code: `src/tokenops/control/policies/time_budget.py`
Tests: `tests/test_time_budget.py`

---

## TL;DR

A cheap circuit breaker on **elapsed wall-clock time** per run. Trips at **observe**
when the run's age reaches the ceiling, and the action it takes is **HALT**. It does
not depend on pricing -- useful when a workflow's cost is latency rather than tokens.

## Detect (formula)

    elapsed(run) >= max_seconds

`elapsed` is `step.ts - window[0].ts` (the current step's timestamp minus the first
recorded step's timestamp). If the window is empty the detector returns None.

## Action it takes to govern -- HALT

Identical mechanism to `cost_budget` and `step_cap`: `Signal(TRIP)` -> `Action(HALT)`
-> flag set before raise -> sticky kill switch. The difference is purely the trigger
(wall-clock age, not spend or step count).

## Why opt-in, not default

Elapsed time is task-dependent -- a legitimate research run may take 30 seconds or
30 minutes. Budget is the universal backstop; `time_budget` is for workflows whose
runtime you actually know and want to bound.

## Edge cases

* Returns None on the first step (empty window) -- no elapsed time to measure yet.
* Trips at **exactly** `max_seconds` elapsed (>=).
* Counts wall-clock time across all node types -- llm, tool, and delegate alike.

## I/O & success criteria (test contract)

| Input | Expect |
|---|---|
| `elapsed >= max_seconds` | `Signal(TRIP)` -> `Action(HALT)` |
| `elapsed < max_seconds` | `None` (ALLOW) |
| empty window | `None` (ALLOW) |
| e2e: two tool crossings, `max_seconds=0.0` | halts on the second |

## Status

Implemented and tested (unit + e2e).
